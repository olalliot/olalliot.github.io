            <p>USER INFORMATION</p>
            <p>------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>I was born in Paris, and had the chance to live in Paris, Brussels, Washington D.C and New York while growing up (that meant moving every 3 years!!)</p>
            <p>After graduating from the Ecole Jeannine Manuel with my Bacclauréat OIB Options Scientifique with <i>Mention Très Bien</i>, I went to the University of Michigan; where I earned my B.S in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>Following my graduation during the slightly tumultuous Spring of 2020, I started working at Wollmuth, Maher and Deutsch, a litigation firm in New York.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I like to pursue a variety of side projects, some of which you can find by selecting the browser icon in the dock below. When I'm not programming, I like to channel my inner frenchman by cooking elaborate recipes that I've found online, and spending some time with my ever troublesome dog Korra </p>
